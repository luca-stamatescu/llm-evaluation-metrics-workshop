[],Does Azure OpenAI use customer data to retrain models?,"Azure OpenAI does not use customer data to retrain models by default. However, Azure OpenAI provides a feature called ""Azure OpenAI on your data"" that allows organizations to generate customized insights, content, and searches using their designated data sources[doc0]. This feature works with the capabilities of the OpenAI models in Azure OpenAI to provide more accurate and relevant responses to user queries in natural language[doc0]. It can be integrated with customer's existing applications and workflows, offers insights into key performance indicators, and can interact with users seamlessly[doc0]. The use of customer data with Azure OpenAI on your data is optional and requires explicit integration and configuration[doc0].","No, Azure OpenAI doesn't use customer data to retrain models.","{""retrieved_documents"": [{""[doc0]"": {""title"": ""17/12/2023, 11:51 Data, privacy, and security for Azure OpenAI Service - Azure AI services | Microsoft Learn"", ""content"": ""17/12/2023, 11:51 Data, privacy, and security for Azure OpenAI Service - Azure AI services | Microsoft Learn\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy 1/7\n\nData, privacy, and security for Azure\n\nOpenAI Service\nArticle \u2022 06/24/2023\n\nThis article provides details regarding how data provided by you to the Azure OpenAI\n\nservice is processed, used, and stored.

To learn more about\n\ncontent filtering, see Azure OpenAI Service content filtering. To learn more about abuse\n\nmonitoring, see abuse monitoring.\n\nContent filtering occurs synchronously as the service processes prompts to generate\n\ncontent as described above and here. No prompts or generated results are stored in the\n\ncontent classifier models, and prompts and results are not used to train, retrain, or\n\nimprove the classifier models.\n\nAzure OpenAI abuse monitoring detects and mitigates instances of recurring content\n\nand/or behaviors that suggest use of the service in a manner that may violate the code\n\nof conduct or other applicable product terms. To detect and mitigate abuse, Azure\n\nOpenAI stores all prompts and generated content securely for up to thirty (30) days. (No\n\nprompts or completions are stored if the customer is approved for and elects to\n\nconfigure abuse monitoring off, as described below.)\n\nThe data store where prompts and completions are stored is logically separated by\n\ncustomer resource (each request includes the resource ID of the customer\u2019s Azure\n\nOpenAI resource). A separate data store is located in each region  in which the Azure\n\nOpenAI Service is available, and a customer\u2019s prompts and generated content are stored\n\nin the Azure region where the customer\u2019s Azure OpenAI service resource is deployed,\n\nwithin the Azure OpenAI service boundary. Human reviewers assessing potential abuse\n\ncan access prompts and completions data only when that data has been flagged by the\n\nabuse monitoring system. The human reviewers are authorized Microsoft employees\n\nwho access the data via point wise queries using request IDs, Secure Access\n\nWorkstations (SAWs), and Just-In-Time (JIT) request approval granted by team\n\nmanagers""}}]}","prompts and generations are not used to train, retrain, or improve the\n\nbase models.",AzureOpenAIKnowledgeBase,AzureOpenAIKnowledgeBase,"gpt_groundedness,f1_score,ada_similarity,gpt_fluency,gpt_coherence,gpt_similarity,gpt_relevance"
