Your job is to compute an accurate evaluation score using the provided evaluation metric.\nuser:\nEquivalence, as a metric, measures the similarity between the predicted answer and the correct answer. If the information and content in the predicted answer is similar or equivalent to the correct answer, then the value of the Equivalence metric should be high, else it should be low. Given the question, correct answer, and predicted answer, determine the value of Equivalence metric using the following rating scale:\nstars:1 the predicted answer is not at all similar to the correct answer\nstars:2 the predicted answer is mostly not similar to the correct answer\nstars:3 the predicted answer is somewhat similar to the correct answer\nstars:4 the predicted answer is mostly similar to the correct answer\nstars:5 the predicted answer is completely similar to the correct answer\n\nThe examples below show the Equivalence score for a question, a correct answer, and a predicted answer.\n\nquestion: What is the role of ribosomes?\ncorrect answer: Ribosomes are cellular structures responsible for protein synthesis. They interpret the genetic information carried by messenger RNA (mRNA) and use it to assemble amino acids into proteins.\npredicted answer: Ribosomes participate in carbohydrate breakdown by removing nutrients from complex sugar molecules.\noutput:{\"stars\":1,\"reason\":\"The predicted answer is not at all similar to the correct answer.

The impact caused the ship's hull to breach, allowing water to flood into the vessel. The ship's design, lifeboat shortage, and lack of timely rescue efforts contributed to the tragic loss of life.\npredicted answer: The sinking of the Titanic was a result of a large iceberg collision. This caused the ship to take on water and eventually sink, leading to the death of many passengers due to a shortage of lifeboats and insufficient rescue attempts.\noutput:{\"stars\":2,\"reason\":\"The predicted answer is mostly not similar to the correct answer. While it mentions the iceberg collision and lifeboat shortage, it omits important details such as the ship's design flaws and the lack of timely rescue efforts.\"}\n\nquestion: What causes seasons on Earth?\ncorrect answer: Seasons on Earth are caused by the tilt of the Earth's axis and its revolution around the Sun. As the Earth orbits the Sun, the tilt causes different parts of the planet to receive varying amounts of sunlight, resulting in changes in temperature and weather patterns.\npredicted answer: Seasons occur because of the Earth's rotation and its elliptical orbit around the Sun. The tilt of the Earth's axis causes regions to be subjected to different sunlight intensities, which leads to temperature fluctuations and alternating weather conditions.\noutput:{\"stars\":3,\"reason\":\"The predicted answer is somewhat similar to the correct answer. It correctly mentions the tilt of the Earth's axis and its effect on sunlight intensity, but incorrectly attributes seasons to the Earth's rotation and elliptical orbit, rather than its revolution around the Sun.\"}\n\nquestion: How does photosynthesis work?\ncorrect answer: Photosynthesis is a process by which green plants and some other organisms convert light energy into chemical energy. This occurs as light is absorbed by chlorophyll molecules, and then carbon dioxide and water are converted into glucose and oxygen through a series of reactions.\npredicted answer: In photosynthesis, sunlight is transformed into nutrients by plants and certain microorganisms. Light is captured by chlorophyll molecules, followed by the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into sugar and oxygen through multiple reactions.\noutput:{\"stars\":4,\"reason\":\"The predicted answer is mostly similar to the correct answer. It accurately describes the role of chlorophyll and the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into sugar and oxygen, but uses slightly different terminology and omits the mention of \"chemical energy.\"\"}\n\nquestion: What are the health benefits of regular exercise?\ncorrect answer: Regular exercise can help maintain a healthy weight, increase muscle and bone strength, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. It also promotes mental well-being by reducing stress and improving overall mood.\npredicted answer: Routine physical activity can contribute to maintaining ideal body weight, enhancing muscle and bone strength, and preventing chronic illnesses. In addition, it supports mental health by alleviating stress and augmenting general mood.\noutput:{\"stars\":5,\"reason\":\"The predicted answer is completely similar to the correct answer.

They interpret the genetic information carried by messenger RNA (mRNA) and use it to assemble amino acids into proteins.\npredicted answer: Ribosomes participate in carbohydrate breakdown by removing nutrients from complex sugar molecules.\noutput:{\"stars\":1,\"reason\":\"The predicted answer is not at all similar to the correct answer. It incorrectly describes the function of ribosomes as being involved in carbohydrate breakdown, which is entirely unrelated to their actual role in protein synthesis.\"}\n\nquestion: Why did the Titanic sink?\ncorrect answer: The Titanic sank after it struck an iceberg during its maiden voyage in 1912. The impact caused the ship's hull to breach, allowing water to flood into the vessel. The ship's design, lifeboat shortage, and lack of timely rescue efforts contributed to the tragic loss of life.\npredicted answer: The sinking of the Titanic was a result of a large iceberg collision. This caused the ship to take on water and eventually sink, leading to the death of many passengers due to a shortage of lifeboats and insufficient rescue attempts.\noutput:{\"stars\":2,\"reason\":\"The predicted answer is mostly not similar to the correct answer. While it mentions the iceberg collision and lifeboat shortage, it omits important details such as the ship's design flaws and the lack of timely rescue efforts.\"}\n\nquestion: What causes seasons on Earth?\ncorrect answer: Seasons on Earth are caused by the tilt of the Earth's axis and its revolution around the Sun. As the Earth orbits the Sun, the tilt causes different parts of the planet to receive varying amounts of sunlight, resulting in changes in temperature and weather patterns.\npredicted answer: Seasons occur because of the Earth's rotation and its elliptical orbit around the Sun. The tilt of the Earth's axis causes regions to be subjected to different sunlight intensities, which leads to temperature fluctuations and alternating weather conditions.\noutput:{\"stars\":3,\"reason\":\"The predicted answer is somewhat similar to the correct answer. It correctly mentions the tilt of the Earth's axis and its effect on sunlight intensity, but incorrectly attributes seasons to the Earth's rotation and elliptical orbit, rather than its revolution around the Sun.\"}\n\nquestion: How does photosynthesis work?\ncorrect answer: Photosynthesis is a process by which green plants and some other organisms convert light energy into chemical energy. This occurs as light is absorbed by chlorophyll molecules, and then carbon dioxide and water are converted into glucose and oxygen through a series of reactions.\npredicted answer: In photosynthesis, sunlight is transformed into nutrients by plants and certain microorganisms. Light is captured by chlorophyll molecules, followed by the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into sugar and oxygen through multiple reactions.\noutput:{\"stars\":4,\"reason\":\"The predicted answer is mostly similar to the correct answer. It accurately describes the role of chlorophyll and the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into sugar and oxygen, but uses slightly different terminology and omits the mention of \"chemical energy.\"\"}\n\nquestion: What are the health benefits of regular exercise?\ncorrect answer: Regular exercise can help maintain a healthy weight, increase muscle and bone strength, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. It also promotes mental well-being by reducing stress and improving overall mood.\npredicted answer: Routine physical activity can contribute to maintaining ideal body weight, enhancing muscle and bone strength, and preventing chronic illnesses. In addition, it supports mental health by alleviating stress and augmenting general mood.\noutput:{\"stars\":5,\"reason\":\"The predicted answer is completely similar to the correct answer. It accurately covers all aspects, including maintaining a healthy weight, enhancing muscle and bone strength, reducing the risk of chronic diseases, and promoting mental well-being.\"}\n\nThe \"stars\" rating should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5. Only output a single integer. The \"reason\" should be 1-3 sentences, explaining the reason for the rating. Output a JSON object following the exact structure shown in the examples. The JSON object should start with { and end with }. You must not add any additional characters before or after. Do not include ```json  at the start or  ``` at the end.\n\nquestion: Does Azure OpenAI use customer data to retrain models?\ncorrect answer:No, Azure OpenAI doesn't use customer data to retrain models.\npredicted answer: Azure OpenAI does not use customer data to retrain models by default. However, Azure OpenAI provides a feature called \"Azure OpenAI on your data\" that allows organizations to generate customized insights, content, and searches using their designated data sources[doc0]. This feature works with the capabilities of the OpenAI models in Azure OpenAI to provide more accurate and relevant responses to user queries in natural language[doc0]. It can be integrated with customer's existing applications and workflows, offers insights into key performance indicators, and can interact with users seamlessly[doc0]. The use of customer data with Azure OpenAI on your data is optional and requires explicit integration and configuration[doc0].\noutput:"

However, Azure OpenAI provides a feature called \"Azure OpenAI on your data\" that allows organizations to generate customized insights, content, and searches using their designated data sources[doc0]. This feature works with the capabilities of the OpenAI models in Azure OpenAI to provide more accurate and relevant responses to user queries in natural language[doc0]. It can be integrated with customer's existing applications and workflows, offers insights into key performance indicators, and can interact with users seamlessly[doc0]. The use of customer data with Azure OpenAI on your data is optional and requires explicit integration and configuration[doc0].\noutput:"

However, Azure OpenAI provides a feature called \"Azure OpenAI on your data\" that allows organizations to generate customized insights, content, and searches using their designated data sources[doc0]. This feature works with the capabilities of the OpenAI models in Azure OpenAI to provide more accurate and relevant responses to user queries in natural language[doc0]. It can be integrated with customer's existing applications and workflows, offers insights into key performance indicators, and can interact with users seamlessly[doc0]. The use of customer data with Azure OpenAI on your data is optional and requires explicit integration and configuration[doc0].\noutput:"

other materials. the great wall is not a single continuous wall but a collection of walls and trenches, with some sections running parallel to each other. it has been the subject of much restoration and preservation work in recent years. today, the great wall is one of the most popular tourist attractions in china, drawing millions of visitors each year.\ngroundtruthcontext: the great wall of

northern china. construction of the wall began in the 7th century bc, with most of the existing wall dating from the ming dynasty (1368–1644). the wall was built to protect chinese states and empires from invasions by various nomadic groups. it is made primarily of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials. the great wall is not a single continuous wall but a collection of walls and trenches, with some sections running parallel to each other. it has been the subject of much restoration and preservation work in recent years. today, the great wall is one of the most popular tourist

seven wonders of the ancient world. the pyramids were constructed using large limestone blocks, with some weighing as much as 80 tons. they served as elaborate tombs for the pharaohs and were intended to ensure their immortality. the construction techniques used to build the pyramids are still a subject of research and debate among historians and archaeologists. the site also includes the sphinx, a

Your job is to compute an accurate evaluation score using the provided evaluation metric.\nuser:\nEquivalence, as a metric, measures the similarity between the predicted answer and the correct answer. If the information and content in the predicted answer is similar or equivalent to the correct answer, then the value of the Equivalence metric should be high, else it should be low. Given the question, correct answer, and predicted answer, determine the value of Equivalence metric using the following rating scale:\nstars:1 the predicted answer is not at all similar to the correct answer\nstars:2 the predicted answer is mostly not similar to the correct answer\nstars:3 the predicted answer is somewhat similar to the correct answer\nstars:4 the predicted answer is mostly similar to the correct answer\nstars:5 the predicted answer is completely similar to the correct answer\n\nThe examples below show the Equivalence score for a question, a correct answer, and a predicted answer.\n\nquestion: What is the role of ribosomes?\ncorrect answer: Ribosomes are cellular structures responsible for protein synthesis. They interpret the genetic information carried by messenger RNA (mRNA) and use it to assemble amino acids into proteins.\npredicted answer: Ribosomes participate in carbohydrate breakdown by removing nutrients from complex sugar molecules.\noutput:{\"stars\":1,\"reason\":\"The predicted answer is not at all similar to the correct answer. It incorrectly describes the function of ribosomes as being involved in carbohydrate breakdown, which is entirely unrelated to their actual role in protein synthesis.\"}\n\nquestion: Why did the Titanic sink?\ncorrect answer: The Titanic sank after it struck an iceberg during its maiden voyage in 1912. The impact caused the ship's hull to breach, allowing water to flood into the vessel. The ship's design, lifeboat shortage, and lack of timely rescue efforts contributed to the tragic loss of life.\npredicted answer: The sinking of the Titanic was a result of a large iceberg collision. This caused the ship to take on water and eventually sink, leading to the death of many passengers due to a shortage of lifeboats and insufficient rescue attempts.\noutput:{\"stars\":2,\"reason\":\"The predicted answer is mostly not similar to the correct answer. While it mentions the iceberg collision and lifeboat shortage, it omits important details such as the ship's design flaws and the lack of timely rescue efforts.\"}\n\nquestion: What causes seasons on Earth?\ncorrect answer: Seasons on Earth are caused by the tilt of the Earth's axis and its revolution around the Sun. As the Earth orbits the Sun, the tilt causes different parts of the planet to receive varying amounts of sunlight, resulting in changes in temperature and weather patterns.\npredicted answer: Seasons occur because of the Earth's rotation and its elliptical orbit around the Sun. The tilt of the Earth's axis causes regions to be subjected to different sunlight intensities, which leads to temperature fluctuations and alternating weather conditions.\noutput:{\"stars\":3,\"reason\":\"The predicted answer is somewhat similar to the correct answer. It correctly mentions the tilt of the Earth's axis and its effect on sunlight intensity, but incorrectly attributes seasons to the Earth's rotation and elliptical orbit, rather than its revolution around the Sun.\"}\n\nquestion: How does photosynthesis work?\ncorrect answer: Photosynthesis is a process by which green plants and some other organisms convert light energy into chemical energy. This occurs as light is absorbed by chlorophyll molecules, and then carbon dioxide and water are converted into glucose and oxygen through a series of reactions.\npredicted answer: In photosynthesis, sunlight is transformed into nutrients by plants and certain microorganisms. Light is captured by chlorophyll molecules, followed by the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into sugar and oxygen through multiple reactions.\noutput:{\"stars\":4,\"reason\":\"The predicted answer is mostly similar to the correct answer. It accurately describes the role of chlorophyll and the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into sugar and oxygen, but uses slightly different terminology and omits the mention of \"chemical energy.\"\"}\n\nquestion: What are the health benefits of regular exercise?\ncorrect answer: Regular exercise can help maintain a healthy weight, increase muscle and bone strength, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. It also promotes mental well-being by reducing stress and improving overall mood.\npredicted answer: Routine physical activity can contribute to maintaining ideal body weight, enhancing muscle and bone strength, and preventing chronic illnesses. In addition, it supports mental health by alleviating stress and augmenting general mood.\noutput:{\"stars\":5,\"reason\":\"The predicted answer is completely similar to the correct answer.

However, Azure OpenAI provides a feature called \"Azure OpenAI on your data\" that allows organizations to generate customized insights, content, and searches using their designated data sources[doc0]. This feature works with the capabilities of the OpenAI models in Azure OpenAI to provide more accurate and relevant responses to user queries in natural language[doc0]. It can be integrated with customer's existing applications and workflows, offers insights into key performance indicators, and can interact with users seamlessly[doc0]. The use of customer data with Azure OpenAI on your data is optional and requires explicit integration and configuration[doc0].\noutput:"

(No\\n\\nprompts or completions are stored if the customer is approved for and elects to\\n\\nconfigure abuse monitoring off, as described below.)\\n\\nThe data store where prompts and completions are stored is logically separated by\\n\\ncustomer resource (each request includes the resource ID of the customer\\u2019s Azure\\n\\nOpenAI resource). A separate data store is located in each region  in which the Azure\\n\\nOpenAI Service is available, and a customer\\u2019s prompts and generated content are stored\\ n\\nin the Azure region where the customer\\u2019s Azure OpenAI service resource is deployed,\\n\\nwithin the Azure OpenAI service boundary. Human reviewers assessing potential abuse\\n\\ncan access prompts and completions data only when that data has been flagged by the\\n\\nabuse monitoring system. The human reviewers are authorized Microsoft employees\\n\\nwho access the data via point wise queries using request IDs, Secure Access\\n\\nWorkstations (SAWs), and Just-In-Time (JIT) request approval granted by team\\n\\nmanagers\"}}]}\nanswer: Azure OpenAI does not use customer data to retrain models by default. However, Azure OpenAI provides a feature called \"Azure OpenAI on your data\" that allows organizations to generate customized insights, content, and searches using their designated data sources[doc0]. This feature works with the capabilities of the OpenAI models in Azure OpenAI to provide more accurate and relevant responses to user queries in natural language[doc0]. It can be integrated with customer's existing applications and workflows, offers insights into key performance indicators, and can interact with users seamlessly[doc0]. The use of customer data with Azure OpenAI on your data is optional and requires explicit integration and configuration[doc0].\noutput:"

To learn more about\\n\\ncontent filtering, see Azure OpenAI Service content filtering. To learn more about abuse\\n\\nmonitoring, see abuse monitoring.\\ n\\nContent filtering occurs synchronously as the service processes prompts to generate\\n\\ncontent as described above and here.

To detect and mitigate abuse, Azure\\n\\nOpenAI stores all prompts and generated content securely for up to thirty (30) days. (No\\n\\nprompts or completions are stored if the customer is approved for and elects to\\n\\nconfigure abuse monitoring off, as described below.)\\n\\nThe data store where prompts and completions are stored is logically separated by\\n\\ncustomer resource (each request includes the resource ID of the customer\\u2019s Azure\\n\\nOpenAI resource). A separate data store is located in each region  in which the Azure\\n\\nOpenAI Service is available, and a customer\\u2019s prompts and generated content are stored\\ n\\nin the Azure region where the customer\\u2019s Azure OpenAI service resource is deployed,\\n\\nwithin the Azure OpenAI service boundary. Human reviewers assessing potential abuse\\n\\ncan access prompts and completions data only when that data has been flagged by the\\n\\nabuse monitoring system. The human reviewers are authorized Microsoft employees\\n\\nwho access the data via point wise queries using request IDs, Secure Access\\n\\nWorkstations (SAWs), and Just-In-Time (JIT) request approval granted by team\\n\\nmanagers\"}}]}\ngroundtruthcontext: testing an error\noutput:"
