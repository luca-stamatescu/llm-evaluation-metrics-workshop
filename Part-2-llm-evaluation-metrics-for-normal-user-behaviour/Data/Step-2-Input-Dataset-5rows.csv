[],Does Azure OpenAI use customer data to retrain models?,"Azure OpenAI does not use customer data to retrain models by default. However, Azure OpenAI provides a feature called ""Azure OpenAI on your data"" that allows organizations to generate customized insights, content, and searches using their designated data sources[doc0]. This feature works with the capabilities of the OpenAI models in Azure OpenAI to provide more accurate and relevant responses to user queries in natural language[doc0]. It can be integrated with customer's existing applications and workflows, offers insights into key performance indicators, and can interact with users seamlessly[doc0].
