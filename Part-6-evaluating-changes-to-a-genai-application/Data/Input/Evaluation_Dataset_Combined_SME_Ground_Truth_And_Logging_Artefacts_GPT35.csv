The embedding is an information dense representation of the semantic meaning of a piece of text. Each embedding is a vector of floating-point numbers, such that the distance between two embeddings in the vector space is correlated with semantic similarity between two inputs in the original format. For example, if two texts are similar, then their vector representations should also be similar. Embeddings power vector similarity search in Azure Databases such as Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore or Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server.</p><h2>Embedding models</h2><p>Different Azure OpenAI embedding models are created to be good at a particular task:</p><p>Similarity embeddings are good at capturing semantic similarity between two or more pieces of text.</p><p>Text search embeddings help measure whether long documents are relevant to a short query.</p><p>Code search embeddings are useful for embedding code snippets and embedding natural language search queries.</p><p>Embeddings make it easier to do machine learning on large inputs representing words by capturing the semantic similarities in a vector space. Therefore, you can use embeddings to determine if two text chunks are semantically related or similar, and provide a score to assess similarity.</p><h2>Cosine similarity</h2><p>Azure OpenAI embeddings rely on cosine similarity to compute similarity between documents and a query.</p><p>From a mathematic perspective, cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multidimensional space. This measurement is beneficial, because if two documents are far apart by Euclidean distance because of size, they could still have a smaller angle between them and therefore higher cosine</p> <p>When you select ""Azure Blob Container"", ""Azure AI Search"", or ""Upload files"" as the data source, you can also select an Ada embedding model deployment to use when ingesting your data. This will create an Azure AI Search index with vector embeddings.</p><p>Why is index creation failing after I added an embedding model?</p><p>Index creation can fail when adding embeddings to your index if the rate limit on your Ada embedding model deployment is too low, or if you have a very large set of documents. You can use this script provided on GitHub to create the index with embeddings manually.</p>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/faq12/13 17/12/2023, 11:50Azure OpenAI Service frequently asked questions - Azure AI services | Microsoft Learn<h1>Customer Copyright Commitment</h1><h1>How do I obtain coverage under the Customer Copyright Commitment?</h1><p>The Customer Copyright Commitment is a provision to be included in the December 1, 2023, Microsoft Product Terms that describes Microsoft’s obligation to defend customers against certain third-party intellectual property claims relating to Output Content.
