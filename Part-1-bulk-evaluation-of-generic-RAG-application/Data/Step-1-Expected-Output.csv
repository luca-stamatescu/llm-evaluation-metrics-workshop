The embedding is an information dense representation of the semantic meaning of a piece of text. Each embedding is a vector of floating-point numbers, such that the distance between two embeddings in the vector space is correlated with semantic similarity between two inputs in the original format. For example, if two texts are similar, then their vector representations should also be similar. Embeddings power vector similarity search in Azure Databases such as Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore or Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server.</p>\n<h2>Embedding models</h2>\n<p>Different Azure OpenAI embedding models are created to be good at a particular task:</p>\n<p>Similarity embeddings are good at capturing semantic similarity between two or more pieces of text.</p>\n<p>Text search embeddings help measure whether long documents are relevant to a short query.</p>\n<p>Code search embeddings are useful for embedding code snippets and embedding natural language search queries.</p>\n<p>Embeddings make it easier to do machine learning on large inputs representing words by capturing the semantic similarities in a vector space. Therefore, you can use embeddings to determine if two text chunks are semantically related or similar, and provide a score to assess similarity.</p>\n<h2>Cosine similarity</h2>\n<p>Azure OpenAI embeddings rely on cosine similarity to compute similarity between documents and a query.</p>\n<p>From a mathematic perspective, cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multidimensional space. This measurement is beneficial, because if two documents are far apart by Euclidean distance because of size, they could still have a smaller angle between them and therefore higher cosine</p>""}}, {""[doc2]"": {""title"": ""/documents/Azure OpenAI Service frequently asked questions - Azure AI services _ Microsoft Learn (1).pdf"", ""content"": ""<p>How much does it cost to use Azure OpenAI on your data?</p>\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/faq\n10/13 <p>17/12/2023, 11:50</p>\n<p>Azure OpenAI Service frequently asked questions - Azure AI services | Microsoft Learn</p>\n<p>When using Azure OpenAI on your data, you incur costs when you use Azure AI Search, Azure Blob Storage, Azure Web App Service, semantic search and OpenAI models.
