Coherence of an answer is measured by how well all the sentences fit together and sound naturally as a whole. Consider the overall quality of the answer when evaluating coherence. Given the question and answer, score the coherence of answer between one to five stars using the following rating scale:
"stars":1 the answer completely lacks coherence
"stars":2 the answer mostly lacks coherence
"stars":3 the answer is partially coherent
"stars":4 the answer is mostly coherent
"stars":5 the answer has perfect coherency

question: What is your favorite indoor activity and why do you enjoy it?
answer: I like pizza. The sun is shining.
output:{"stars":1,"reason":"The answer completely lacks coherence. The sentences do not relate to each other or to the question, making the overall response disjointed and irrelevant. Specifically, mentioning pizza and the weather has no connection to the question about an indoor activity and why it is enjoyed."}

question: Can you describe your favorite movie without giving away any spoilers?
answer: It is a science fiction movie. There are dinosaurs. The actors eat cake. People must stop the villain.
output:{"stars":2,"reason":"The answer mostly lacks coherence. While the sentences are loosely related to describing a movie, they do not fit together naturally and the information is quite random and disjointed. Specifically, the detail about actors eating cake seems out of place and disrupts the flow of the description."}

question: What are some benefits of regular exercise?
answer: Regular exercise improves your mood. A good workout also helps you sleep better. Trees are green.
output:{"stars":3,"reason":"The answer is partially coherent. Most of the sentences are related to the benefits of regular exercise, but the last sentence about trees being green is completely unrelated, breaking the overall coherence. Specifically, mentioning the color of trees has no relevance to the topic of exercise benefits."}

question: How do you cope with stress in your daily life?
answer: I usually go for a walk to clear my head. Listening to music helps me relax as well. Stress is a part of life, but we can manage it through some activities.
output:{"stars":4,"reason":"The answer is mostly coherent. The sentences are related and flow naturally together, but there is slight room for improvement in making the answer even more cohesive. Specifically, the last sentence could be more tightly connected to the specific activities mentioned earlier."}

question: What can you tell me about climate change and its effects on the environment?
answer: Climate change has far-reaching effects on the environment. Rising temperatures result in the melting of polar ice caps, contributing to sea-level rise. Additionally, more frequent and severe weather events, such as hurricanes and heatwaves, can cause disruption to ecosystems and human societies alike.
output:{"stars":5,"reason":"The answer has perfect coherency. The sentences are well-connected and logically follow one another, presenting a clear and comprehensive explanation of the effects of climate change on the environment. Specifically, each point builds on the previous one, contributing to a coherent and logical overall response."}

The "stars" rating should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5. Only output a single integer. The "reason" should be 1-3 sentences, explaining the reason for the rating. Output a JSON object following the exact structure shown in the examples. The JSON object should start with { and end with }. You must not add any additional characters before or after. Do not include ```json  at the start or  ``` at the end.
