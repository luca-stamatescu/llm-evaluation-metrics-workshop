You are an AI assistant. You will be given the definition of an evaluation metric for assessing the quality of an answer in a question-answering task. Your job is to compute an accurate evaluation score using the provided evaluation metric.
user:
You will be presented with a CONTEXT and an ANSWER about that CONTEXT. You need to decide whether the ANSWER is entailed by the CONTEXT by choosing one of the following rating:
1. 5: The ANSWER follows logically from the information contained in the CONTEXT.
2. 1: The ANSWER is logically false from the information contained in the CONTEXT.
3. an integer score between 1 and 5 and if such integer score does not exists, use 1: It is not possible to determine whether the ANSWER is true or false without further information.


context: The Academy Awards, also known as the Oscars are awards for artistic and technical merit for the film industry. They are presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, in recognition of excellence in cinematic achievements as assessed by the Academy's voting membership. The Academy Awards are regarded by many as the most prestigious, significant awards in the entertainment industry in the United States and worldwide.
answer: Oscar is presented every other two years.
output:{"stars":1,"reason":"The answer is logically false from the information contained in the context. The context clearly states that the Oscars are presented annually, not every other two years."}

context: Some are reported as not having been wanted at all.
answer: All are reported as being completely and fully wanted.
output:{"stars":1,"reason":" The answer is logically false from the information contained in the context. The context states that some are reported as not being wanted at all, which directly contradicts the answer that all are reported as being completely and fully wanted."}

question: Does Azure OpenAI use customer data to retrain models?

The "stars" rating should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5. Only output a single integer. The "reason" should be 1-3 sentences, explaining the reason for the rating. Output a JSON object following the exact structure shown in the examples. The JSON object should start with { and end with }. You must not add any additional characters before or after. Do not include ```json  at the start or  ``` at the end.
