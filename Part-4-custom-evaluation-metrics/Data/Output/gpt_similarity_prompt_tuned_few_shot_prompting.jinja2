Equivalence, as a metric, measures the similarity between the predicted answer and the correct answer. If the information and content in the predicted answer is similar or equivalent to the correct answer, then the value of the Equivalence metric should be high, else it should be low. Given the question, correct answer, and predicted answer, determine the value of Equivalence metric using the following rating scale:
stars:1 the predicted answer is not at all similar to the correct answer
stars:2 the predicted answer is mostly not similar to the correct answer
stars:3 the predicted answer is somewhat similar to the correct answer
stars:4 the predicted answer is mostly similar to the correct answer
stars:5 the predicted answer is completely similar to the correct answer

The examples below show the Equivalence score for a question, a correct answer, and a predicted answer.

question: Does Azure OpenAI use customer data to retrain models?
correct answer: No, Azure OpenAI doesn't use customer data to retrain models.
predicted answer: Yes, Azure OpenAI uses customer data to retrain models.
output:{"stars": 1,"reason": "The predicted answer is not at all similar to the correct answer. It incorrectly states that Azure OpenAI uses customer data to retrain models, which is the opposite of the correct information."}

question: Is the latest release of the OpenAI Python library (version>=1.0) supported by Azure OpenAI?
correct answer: Yes, Azure OpenAI is supported by the latest release of the OpenAI Python library (version>=1.0).
predicted answer: No, Azure OpenAI does not support the latest release of the OpenAI Python library.
output:{"stars": 2,"reason": "The predicted answer is mostly not similar to the correct answer. It incorrectly states that Azure OpenAI does not support the latest release of the OpenAI Python library, which is incorrect."}
 
question: Does Azure OpenAI support GPT-4 models?
correct answer: Yes, Azure OpenAI supports GPT-4 models. GPT-4 can solve difficult problems with greater accuracy than previous models and is optimized for chat and traditional completion tasks. It is available in various regions, including Sweden, Central US, North US, and others. Additionally, there are different versions of GPT-4, such as GPT-4 (0314), GPT-4 (0613), GPT-4 (1106-preview), and GPT-4 (vision-preview).
predicted answer: Yes, Azure OpenAI supports GPT-4 models.
output:{"stars": 3,"reason": "The predicted answer is somewhat similar to the correct answer. It correctly states that Azure OpenAI supports GPT-4 models but lacks the detailed explanation about the different versions and regional availability."}
 
question: Can I find GPT-4 Turbo Preview in Azure OpenAI?
correct answer: Yes, GPT-4 Turbo Preview is available in Azure OpenAI. It is listed under the model availability for regions such as Australia East, Canada East, East US 2, France, Sweden Central, and Switzerland. However, it is important to note that this model is in preview and is not recommended for production use. All deployments of this preview model will be automatically updated to a stable version once it becomes available.
predicted answer: Yes, GPT-4 Turbo Preview is available in Azure OpenAI. It is available in several regions, including Australia East, Canada East, and East US 2.
output:{"stars": 4,"reason": "The predicted answer is mostly similar to the correct answer. It accurately mentions the availability of GPT-4 Turbo Preview in Azure OpenAI and lists some regions, but it omits the caution about its preview status and automatic updates."}
 
question: Are VNETs and Private Endpoints supported by Azure OpenAI?
correct answer: Yes, Azure OpenAI supports VNETs and Private Endpoints as part of Azure AI services.
predicted answer: Yes, Azure OpenAI supports VNETs and Private Endpoints.
output:{"stars": 5,"reason": "The predicted answer is completely similar to the correct answer. It accurately states that Azure OpenAI supports VNETs and Private Endpoints."}

The "stars" rating should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5. Only output a single integer. The "reason" should be 1-3 sentences, explaining the reason for the rating. Output a JSON object following the exact structure shown in the examples. The JSON object should start with { and end with }. You must not add any additional characters before or after. Do not include ```json  at the start or  ``` at the end.
